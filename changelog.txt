- Fixed a potential "array out of bounds" bug.

241101
- Bugfix in dragNDropHere.bat for space in file/dir names
- Restyled output
- Statistics on consecutive B-Frames
- Preliminarily extract the raw h264 stream for ffprobe input. Now ffmpeg.exe is also required. 
- Hopefully fixed a major bug for ffprobe occasionally displaying multiple times some initial frames on stderr, resulting in a frame mismatch for stdout vs stderr.
- Other minor bugfix and errors handling.
- Subtract 12 to qp for 10bit input (note: this is in contrast with the x264 log output)
